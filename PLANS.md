### Assignment

* Visit the home pages of some of the students. Pick a student you don't know yet. Open an issue on your assignment repository.
(I think issues are not enabled on the repository use for the GitHub pages.)
Suggest an improvement to the web site or suggest a topit to cover on the web site. In the issue mention me (@szabgab) so I'll be notified.
