### Participation in the lectures

There is no requirement to participate in the lectures. You will be able to watch the videos later. However, it is recommended to participate as that gives you an opportunity to ask questions.

### Timestamps

Each video will be around 1 hour long. In order to make it easier to access the specific topics I would like to add timestamps to each video. A timestamp looks like this:

```
00:00 Start
01:30 Installation
```

Meaning at 1 minute 30 seconds I started to talk about Installation.

I'll need volunteers to prepare these timestamps for each video on the day after the lecture.
You basically need to watch the video and write down all the points where you think you or someone else would like to jump to. You can see such timestamps in the comments of many YouTube videos.
We will have an [issue](https://github.com/szabgab/wis-python-course-2024-04/issues) where you'll be able to volunteer.

### Assignments

There will be assignments after every lecture. You will submit them via GitHub. I'll explain the details during the lectures.

### Project

Towards the end of the course you'll be asked to do a project.
First you need to submit a proposal for the project and when it is accepted then implement it.
The project should be something that is useful for your studies or at least it is fun for you to make.
Ask in the lab where you work what needs are there that you might implement as your final project.
You can get inspiration from the projects [listed here](https://code-maven.com/programming-bootcamp-for-scientists)
and the [projects of the 2023 autumn semester](https://github.com/szabgab/wis-python-bootcamp-2023-12).

### Grades

* Each assignment counts as 5% (we will have 10 of them).
* The project proposal is 15%.
* The project is 35%.

* The project is a requirement. Without that you won't get a passing grade.

### Slides

During the course I'll use some of the [slides that can be found here](https://code-maven.com/slides/python/).
These slides are publicly available and will remain on the web site after the course is over.

### Videos in English

There are [recording of this course from 3 years ago](https://code-maven.com/programming-bootcamp-for-scientists).

There are also [recordings from the 2023 autumn semester](https://github.com/szabgab/wis-python-bootcamp-2023-12).

You can watch those, but be also warned, this semester the order of the material will be different.

There are many more videos in my [English-language YouTube channel](https://code-maven.com/youtube).
You are invited to check them out and to follow the channel.

### Videos in Hebrew

Some of the material is also available in Hebrew. You can find them [on my website](https://he.code-maven.com/)
and in my [Hebrew-language YouTube channel](https://he.code-maven.com/youtube). You are invited to
follow that channel as well.

### Language

The standard language of WIS and of this course is English.

However, when on one-on-one conversions I'd be happy to speak in Hebrew, Hungarian, Spanish, or Ladino.

### Installations

There is no need to install anything up front. We'll do that during the lectures.
